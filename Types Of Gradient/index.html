     Types Of Gradient : Linear, Radial, Conic

     what is gradient?
     A gradient is a gradual transition between two or more colors. It is often used in design and art to create a visually appealing effect.

        
     
    Linear Gradient:

    A linear gradient transitions colors along a straight line. You can specify the direction of the gradient using angles or keywords like "to right", "to left", "to top", and "to bottom".


    Example of Linear Gradient in CSS:
    background: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);

    Radial Gradient:
    A radial gradient transitions colors radiating from a central point outward in a circular or elliptical shape

    Example of Radial Gradient in CSS:
    background: radial-gradient(circle, blue, green);


    Conic Gradient:
    A conic gradient transitions colors around a central point, creating a cone-like effect. The colors are distributed around the center in a circular manner.

    Example of Conic Gradient in CSS:
    background: conic-gradient(from 0deg, red, yellow, green, blue, red);
