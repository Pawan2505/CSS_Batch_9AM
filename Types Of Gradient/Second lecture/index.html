    - Types Of Gradient : Linear, Radial, Conic

    What is Gradient ?
    A gradient is a gradual blend between multiple colors. In CSS, gradients are used to create smooth transitions between colors for backgrounds, borders, and other elements.

    Types of Gradients in CSS:

    1. Linear Gradient:
       A linear gradient transitions colors along a straight line. You can specify the direction (angle) and the colors to be used in the gradient.
       Example:
       background: linear-gradient(to right, red, blue);


    2. Radial Gradient:
         A radial gradient radiates from a central point outward in a circular or elliptical shape. You can define the center, shape, size, and colors.
         Example:
         background: radial-gradient(circle, yellow, green);


    3. Conic Gradient:
         A conic gradient creates a gradient that rotates around a central point, similar to the way colors are arranged in a color wheel. You can specify the starting angle and colors.
         Example:
            background: conic-gradient(from 0deg, pink, purple, orange);
