    Before, After, Transform, Hover & Transition

    - Transform Property : translate, rotate, scale, skew Hover - :hover

    - Transition Property : duration, timing-function, delay, property

    before & after Pseudo Elements:

    why use before & after Pseudo Elements?
    - to add cosmetic content to an element with the help of CSS only

    - they are inline by default
    - they require the content property to be defined
    - they are used with the ::before and ::after selectors
    - they are children of the selected element
    Example:
    .element::before {
        content: " ";
        display: block;
        width: 100px;
        height: 100px;
        background-color: red;
    }


    what is Transform Property?

    Transform Property : translate, rotate, scale, skew
    - it allows you to modify the coordinate space of the CSS visual formatting model.
    - it allows you to move, rotate, scale, and skew elements.
    - it does not affect the position of surrounding elements.
    - it is commonly used with the transition property to create smooth animations.
    Example:
    .element {
        transform: rotate(45deg);
    }
    

    what is Transition Property?
    Transition Property : duration, timing-function, delay, property

    - it allows you to change property values smoothly (over a given duration).
    - it is a shorthand property for four transition properties: transition-property, transition-duration, transition
    -timing-function, transition-delay.
    - it is commonly used with the transform property to create smooth animations.
