    what is position?

    The position property in CSS is used to specify the type of positioning method for an element.

    Types of Positioning:

    1. Static Positioning:
       - Default positioning for all HTML elements.
       - Elements are positioned according to the normal flow of the document.
       - Example:
         ```css
         .static-example {
             position: static;
         }
         ```

    2. Relative Positioning:
       - The element is positioned relative to its normal position.

         - You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to move the element from its normal position.

         - Example:
            ```css
            .relative-example {
                position: relative;
                top: 10px; /* Moves the element 10px down from its normal position */
                left: 20px; /* Moves the element 20px to the right from its normal position */
            }
            ```
    3. Absolute Positioning:
         - The element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with a position other than static). If there is no such ancestor, it is positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the viewport).
         - The element is removed from the normal document flow and set in starting parent and form stack.
         - Example:
            ```css
            .absolute-example {
                 position: absolute;
                 top: 50px; /* Positions the element 50px from the top of its containing block */
                 left: 100px; /* Positions the element 100px from the left of its containing block */
            }
            ```

    4. Fixed Positioning:
         - The element is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it stays in the same place

              even when the page is scrolled.
            - The element is removed from the normal document flow.
            - Example:
                ```css
                .fixed-example {
                    position: fixed;
                    top: 0; /* Positions the element at the top of the viewport */
                    right: 0; /* Positions the element at the right of the viewport */
                }
                ```

    5. Sticky Positioning:
         - The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

            - Example:
                ```css
                .sticky-example {
                    position: sticky;
                    top: 0; /* The element will stick to the top of the viewport when you reach its scroll position */
                }
                ```
    6. Z-Index:
         - The z-index property specifies the stack order of positioned elements (elements with a position value other than static).
         - An element with a higher z-index is always in front of an element with a lower z-index.
         - Example:
            ```css
            .z-index-example {
                position: absolute;
                z-index: 10; /* This element will be on top of elements with a lower z-index */
            }
            ```


    7. Overflow:
         - The overflow property specifies what happens if content overflows an element's box.  
            - Common values are visible, hidden, scroll, and auto.

            - Example:
                ```css
                .overflow-example {
                    width: 200px;
                    height: 100px;
                    overflow: auto; /* Adds scrollbars if content overflows */
                }
                ```
