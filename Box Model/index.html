- Ex : Create Box Design (Padding, Margin, Content, Border)



    Box Model: The CSS box model is a fundamental concept in web design that describes how elements on a webpage are structured and how their dimensions are calculated. It consists of several layers that surround the content of an element:


    1. Content: This is the innermost layer where the actual content (text, images, etc.) of the element resides. The width and height properties define the size of this content area.

    2. Padding: Padding is the space between the content and the border of the element. It creates an inner margin that pushes the content away from the edges of the element. Padding can be set individually for each side (top, right, bottom, left) or uniformly for all sides.

    3. Border: The border is the line that surrounds the padding (if any) and content of the element. It can have various styles (solid, dashed, dotted, etc.), widths, and colors.

    4. Margin: Margin is the outermost layer that creates space between the element's border and neighboring elements. It helps control the spacing between elements on a webpage.

    5. Box-sizing: The box-sizing property determines how the total width and height of an element are calculated. It can be set to "content-box" (default) or "border-box." In "content-box," width and height apply to the content area only, while in "border-box," they include padding and border.
